    "# Predicting & Optimising Iron Ore Concentrations \n",
    "\n",
    "This demo is a simplified, real-world-inspired example designed to showcase how Databricks enables end-to-end model development and deployment â€” from data ingestion and exploration to model training, optimisation, and operationalisation â€” all within a unified platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of iron ore processing, controlling iron (Fe) and silica (SiOâ‚‚) concentrations is critical for producing high-quality feedstock for steelmaking. One commonly used method in mineral processing is froth flotation, which removes silica from iron-bearing minerals like magnetite and hematite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Flotation Works in Iron Ore Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Froth flotation is a common method used to separate silica (SiOâ‚‚) from iron-bearing minerals like hematite or magnetite. The goal is to reduce the silica content in the iron ore concentrate, improving the ore's quality for steel production.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Process Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grinding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iron ore is ground into fine particles to liberate iron minerals from gangue (waste rock), primarily silica.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reagents are added to the slurry (water + ground ore):\n",
    "  - Collectors (e.g., ether amines) make silica hydrophobic.\n",
    "  - Depressants (e.g., starch) prevent iron minerals from floating.\n",
    "- Air Injection & Frothing:\n",
    "  - Air bubbles are introduced into the slurry.\n",
    "  - Hydrophobic silica particles attach to the bubbles and float to the surface.\n",
    "  - Hydrophilic iron particles stay in the slurry and are collected as concentrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation:\n",
    "  - Froth containing silica is skimmed off.\n",
    "  - The remaining slurry contains the upgraded iron concentrate with reduced silica.\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… Silica Concentration Quality Criteria\n",
    "The acceptable level of silica (SiOâ‚‚) in iron ore concentrate depends on its end-use (usually for steelmaking) and customer requirements.  Higher silica affects the slag volume, increases energy consumption, and decreases efficiency in the furnace."

    "In this demo, we use historical plant [data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aditya100/quality-prediction-in-iron-ore) (e.g., pH, reagent dosage, pulp density, air flow rate) to train machine learning models that predict Fe and SiOâ‚‚ concentrations. We also run an optimisation routines, for example, to determine the ideal setpoints that maximise Fe concentration while keeping SiOâ‚‚ within specification.\n",
